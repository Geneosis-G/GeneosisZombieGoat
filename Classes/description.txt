[b]DEV NOTES[/b]
[quote=About this mod] Another little mod that was really fun to code ^^ Creating the zombification effect took almost no time (used the particles of the Repulsive Goat, ragdolled some parts of the humans skeleton and replaced angry sounds by zombie sounds).
Then there was the interesting part: Making sombies attack the player! Hopefully, the 1.1 update added a capture the flag mode to the NPC AIs so I just reused it to make zombies protect a virtual flag sticked to the zombie.
The hardest point was the zombie random movement when there is no player to attack. For this part I had to mess a bit with "states programming" which is unusual for me but used a lot in unreal script. I lost a lot of hours trying to figure ou why the AI didn't want to enter my custom state, then I ended up calling the GoToState() every tick to force it to do what I wanted X)
